# DOJO-BLOG: A Simple React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## WHY DOJO-BLOG?

As a developer who had largely worked on backend features, I wanted more exposure to frontend development like React, JS, TS, etc in order to really round out my portfolio. This project is a simple one to try implementing the basics of React on my own (routing, fetching, hooks, etc). Getting started is probably the most daunting step of all, but with this completed I can safely say I'm getting there :~).
