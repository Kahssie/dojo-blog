      "body": "Mark but this flea, and mark in this,\nHow little that which thou deny’st me is:\nMe it sucked first, and now sucks thee,\nAnd in this flea our two bloods mingled be;\nConfess it! This cannot be said\nA sin, or shame, or loss of maidenhead;\nYet this enjoys before it woo,\nAnd pampered swells with one blood made of two,\nAnd this, alas, is more than we would do.\n\n\nOh stay! Three lives in one flea spare\nWhere we almost—nay, more than–married are:\nThis flea is you and I, and this\nOur marriage-bed and marriage-temple is.\nThough parents grudge, and you, we’re met\nAnd cloistered in these living walls of jet.\nThough use make thee apt to kill me,\nLet not to this self-murder added be,\nAnd sacrilege—three sins in killing three.\n\n\nCruel and sudden! Hast thou since\nPurpled thy nail in blood of innocence?\nIn what could this flea guilty be,\nExcept in that drop which it sucked from thee?\nYet thou triumph’st, and says’t that thou\nFind’st not thyself nor me the weaker now:\n’Tis true: then learn how false fears be:\nJust so much honour, when thou yield’st to me,\nWill waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee.",
